# Discrete-CA-for-tumoral-growth-implementation
Parallel implementation of tumoral growth using a discrete celullar automata, based on Dustin D.Phan work.

To execute the simulation we just need to:

  *javac Simulatore.java*
  
  *java Simulatore*
  
And the GUI will display. If we want to select the dimension of the pane where the simulation will be done we just need to enter a number in the box 'dimension', if we want to create the initial pane push 'crear simulacion', to run it 'iniciar simulacion' and to stop it 'fin'.
